# 🚚 Smart ETA Monitor
**Smart ETA Monitor** is a **machine learning–based dashboard** for predicting **delivery ETA (in minutes)** in last-mile delivery operations.
Beyond prediction, the application provides model diagnostics (residual analysis, segment error), global explainability, and late-risk prioritization using lift/gain analysis to support data-driven operational decisions.

The system is built with an end-to-end ML pipeline covering preprocessing, inference, and evaluation, and is deployed using Streamlit for interactive exploration.

**Tech stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, Streamlit.
